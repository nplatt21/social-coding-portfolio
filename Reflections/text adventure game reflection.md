This was my favorite activity to do by far. The storytelling aspect of it was fun coming up with a little adventure. but the coding was more free flowing than the other assignments. I specifically enjoyed coming up with ways to connect the different elements together while keeping the story comprehensible. It also felt really cool to use very simple code like if, elif, and else to make my own game. Also defining the different segments was a good challenge. It was also a good refresher on strip and lower comands. I had a problem at one point where i made the answer to the riddle uppercase but but i was cleaning it so it was impossible to get right and I couldn't figure out why. But overall a very fun and informative activity and i will make more games like this in the future for shure.
