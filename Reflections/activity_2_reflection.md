This activity was much more difficult than the first activity. I struggled a little bit with the loops but after reading some instructions online and brushing up on them I got through it. the lists were easier pretty simple just checking syntax was my main issue. but I just had to go back and read over them slowly to check for any syntax errors. once I got the hang of Loops they were very quick and efficient. The functions part at the end was also a very useful refresher.I tried the extra credit on this one I had a lot of errors but I think I did it correctly I'm not completely sure though. Had to look up a lot of stuff online.
